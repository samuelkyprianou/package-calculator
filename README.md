This project is a lightweight API which accepts a number and determines what quantities of a range of pre-defined pack-sizes are required to fulfil the order. The Supported packsizes are as follows: 250, 500, 750, 1000, 2000, 5000 With the intention to support addition and removal of packsizes in future. As pack sizes cannot be adjusted, the role of the api is to return the minimum number items, broken down into the minimum number of packs in order to fulfill the order. The calculation prioritises item numbers over pack numbers, meaning that a greater number of packs which delivers a fewer number of items is favoured over fewer packs which return more items.

Example test cases are as follows:

Items ordered	Correct number of packs	Incorrect number of packs
1	2 x 250	1 x 500
250	1 x 250	1 x 500
251	1 x 500	2 x 250
501	1 x 500, 1 x 250	1 x 1000 OR 3 x 250
8500	1 x 5000, 1 x 2000, 1 x 1000 , 1 x 500	1 x 5000, 2 x 2000
12001	2 x 5000, 1 x 2000, 1 x 250	3 x 5000

Deployed Application

Local Setup
If you would like to test this API locally, please clone the repository, and run go get . in the root of the repository. Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the application using go run ., additionally if you would like to run the test file which has been created for the pack quantity calculation, please run cd calculatepacks followed by go test.
